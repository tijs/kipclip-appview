              What is AT Protocol?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              AT Protocol is an open, decentralized social networking protocol.
              It's the technology that powers Bluesky and allows your data to be
              portable across different apps and services. Think of it like
              email - you own your address and can use it with different email
              clients.

              Can I use my Bluesky account to sign in?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Yes! Your Bluesky account is an AT Protocol account. Just enter
              your Bluesky handle (like alice.bsky.social) to sign in. kipclip
              works seamlessly with Bluesky because they both use AT Protocol.

              How does the login process work?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              When you sign in, kipclip uses OAuth to securely connect to your
              Personal Data Server (PDS). This is the same secure login method
              used by apps like Twitter or Google. You'll be redirected to your
              PDS to authorize kipclip, then redirected back. Your password is
              never shared with kipclip.

              Where are my bookmarks stored?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Your bookmarks are stored in your own Personal Data Server (PDS),
              not on kipclip's servers. If you use Bluesky, that's your Bluesky
              PDS. This means you own your data and can access it with other AT
              Protocol apps that support the bookmark format.

              Can I use a custom domain as my handle?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Yes! If you've set up a custom domain handle with AT Protocol
              (like yourname.com), you can use it to sign in to kipclip. Just
              enter your custom domain handle instead of a .bsky.social handle.

              Is my data portable?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Absolutely! Because your bookmarks are stored using the community
              bookmark lexicon on your PDS, you can access them with any other
              AT Protocol app that supports this format. You're not locked into
              kipclip - your data is truly yours.

              Are my bookmarks private?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              No, AT Protocol records are public by default. This means
              bookmarks you save with kipclip can be discovered by others.
              Please don't save anything sensitive or private. Think of kipclip
              bookmarks like public social media posts.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              No, kipclip is an independent project built on top of AT Protocol.
              It's designed to work with any AT Protocol account, including
              Bluesky accounts, but it's not officially affiliated with Bluesky
              Social PBC.
